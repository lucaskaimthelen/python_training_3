# Python slicing. Slice start, stop, step
# slicing is very powerful and can be used on strings, lists or tuples.
# Index starts at 0.
w = "yadf;lkbdfmbdfklmbmbkm"
# Can start at the end of the string, list or tuple.
print(w[0:-1])
print(w[0:21])
print(w[:21])
print(w[0:6])

# Reverse order of string. This works on lists as well.
# This can be useful when deleting elements out of a list because one needs
# to start at the end of the list first.
print(w[::-1])
